# FizzBuzz.java
 
This is just the regular FizzBuzz programming exercise.

## FizzBuzz Rules

* FizzBuzz counts up to a certain number
* If the number is a multiple of 3, it will print 'Fizz'
* If the number is a multiple of 5, it will print 'Buzz'
* If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it will print 'FizzBuzz'
* If the number isn't a multiple of 3 or 5, it will just print the number
